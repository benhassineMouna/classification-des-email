Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\"}\n",

      "{'date': 'Tue, 26 Sep 2000 09', 'subject': 'Investment Structure', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'kholst@enron.com', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.

      "{'date': 'Tue, 26 Sep 2000 09', 'subject': 'Investment Structure', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'pallen70@hotmail.com', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/26/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.

Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.\"We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. \"That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.\"A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.\"These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,\" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.\"The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.\"With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.\"It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,\" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.\"We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.\"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,\"said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way.\"', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Thomas A Martin, Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Jay Reitmeyer, Frank Ermis'}\n",

TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let\\'s talk.'}\n",

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.

We are pursuing a confidentialityagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enableus to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholdervalue by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and byreducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via aweather product.As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue othercandidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategyto ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate ouropportunities.

In preparation for that meeting we would like togain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What aretypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your maincontacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving ourcontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probablyhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with thecommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from theircommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of monthindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  Thatrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.'}\n",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California\\'s problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.

This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information.'}\n",

According to BPA,it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meetbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it hadbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that thesales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today thanyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California becauseof concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sendingexchange energy into California, however.More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of theWestern Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.\"}\n",

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.

I recognize that Sagewood iscurrently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer tothe appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the marketwill sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablelyincrease to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that wecannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip\"}\n",

Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty\\'s tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  Irealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor andyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and beworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are runningan errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at thistime.  We can look at again later in the year.I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.Phillip'}\n",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn\\'t enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\\'s still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.\\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn\\'t result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

(DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state\\'s powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company\\'s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"Thomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict\\'s\" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.\"I guess our position is, \\'Gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.\"We\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\\'s explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Onewing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  Thisplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with thecourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoorliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglassskylights supported by metal posts.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance andrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra laborcost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent onrepairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsitemanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager hasinterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male managerthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to amanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manageronsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If youwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structurethis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive.

Cash NeedsSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II.

Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV.

Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentiallycomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed withthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (ofwhat, I\\'m not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs whoswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for theQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December(and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take theForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to getsome assurances of payment.SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are dueon 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E\\'spurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can beresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.

      "{'date': '01/20/01 22', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'mike.grigsby@enron.com', 'body': 'By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York MercantileExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gasstorage number.The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and theforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated asupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.\"Traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson,a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\"But the market\\'s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American GasAssociation\\'s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled thestorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view thenumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker thanreality.\"It\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand whatwe are reporting,\" McGill said.As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators forthe rise in gas prices.\"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.\"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.\"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December\\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.\"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said.A year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.\"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\\'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation\\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\\'s cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.\"I was getting worried,\" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January\\'s weather turned warmer.Wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\\'s gas purchasing practices.\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\\'s time to considersome changes.\"To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail toseverly@kcstar.com.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star'}\n",

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

The project is a 134 unit apartment complex inSan Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly acouple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would liketo find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does notrequire the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way tostructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that hasbeen mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce theequity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of thisnature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim topermanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will beimportant to banks.I am faxing you a project summary.

Ifyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards salesabove monthly index without enough consideration of futurereplacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should beinjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meetdemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in orderto fill storage?2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away toomuch gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting theirown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas thantheir injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to shortterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the majorLDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floatingrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers marketand theconsumer has benefitted.Call me if you need any more input.Phillip\"}\n",

Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.

Any possibility for a=deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=us is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=ll be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=l disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the =details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should get =paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20=20According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.=20Key Points of the Bridge Financing=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%Current Projected=20For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=the DWR proportionately from rate payments.'}\n",

      "{'date': 'Tue, 24 Oct 2000 06', 'subject': 'Investment Structure', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Keith Holst', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.\"The market\\'s been waiting for this day for a long time,\" aStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn\\'t lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.Thursday\\'s system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday\\'s last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.Vattenfall\\'s Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.Today\\'s rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday\\'s news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone=0F$- daily.pdf'}\n",

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but nowwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000Allan SeverudeMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECTFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidatedWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but nowwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000Allan SeverudeMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECTFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidatedWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today.Sincerely,George W.

It appears that a singlebuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid abovemarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices werebypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the indexcalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associatedfinancial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.

In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC- winmail.dat'}\n",

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.

Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.\"We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. \"That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.\"A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.\"These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,\" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.\"The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.\"With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.\"It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,\" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.\"We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.\"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,\"said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way.\"', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Thomas A Martin, Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Jay Reitmeyer, Frank Ermis'}\n",

TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let\\'s talk.'}\n",

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.

David Moore spent over 10 yearslearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that havelasted over 2000 years.

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.'}\n",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California\\'s problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.  Hope this info helps.

      "{'date': 'Tue, 10 Apr 2001 10', 'subject': 'CAISO demand reduction', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Mike Grigsby', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2001Enron North America Corp.Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, ChrisMallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT,Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill WilliamsIII/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECTPhillip et al.,the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information.'}\n",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn\\'t enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\\'s still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.\\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn\\'t result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state\\'s powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company\\'s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"Thomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict\\'s\" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.\"I guess our position is, \\'Gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.\"We\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\\'s explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

I spoke to him about the possibility of your calland he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by KippFlores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left veryoptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas aboutmoving this project forward.Phillip\"}\n",

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of whichcurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into thisproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major designand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm ofour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed orrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on apercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based onyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%,or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For thesecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 peryear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of thesevaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes theforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, inthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of futureprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 permonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in theattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest bringsthe total net buyout to $78,946.?We still believe that this project needs the professional services that weoffer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyoutoffer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we areprepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.?If this is yourchoice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.?

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provideLand -                   $1,121,670Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000Cash Equity              $1,419,268Total                    $2,955,9387.

Their version includes the salary of asuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to thirdparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\"fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would bepaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finallythe builders profit of 1.4 million.Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers outof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, ifthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in additionto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have beenin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates andthe superintendents are listed but I don\\'t think the construction managementfee is included.George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I willreview and let you know what I think.The GP issues don\\'t seem to be a point of contention.

The missing money on thespreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?6.  #14  missed on 2/2?7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?8.  #20a missed on 2/2?9.  #35 missed on 2/2?My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.You may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that I don\\'t remember onsome of these.

The other wing would have a garage +guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  Thisplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with thecourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoorliving.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance andrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra laborcost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent onrepairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsitemanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager hasinterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male managerthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to amanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manageronsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If youwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structurethis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.

Cash NeedsSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst'}\n",

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.

      "{'date': '01/20/01 22', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'mike.grigsby@enron.com', 'body': 'By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York MercantileExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gasstorage number.The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and theforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated asupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.\"Traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson,a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\"But the market\\'s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American GasAssociation\\'s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled thestorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view thenumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker thanreality.\"It\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand whatwe are reporting,\" McGill said.As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators forthe rise in gas prices.\"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.\"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.\"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December\\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.\"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said.A year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.\"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\\'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation\\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\\'s cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.\"I was getting worried,\" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January\\'s weather turned warmer.Wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\\'s gas purchasing practices.\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\\'s time to considersome changes.\"To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail toseverly@kcstar.com.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star'}\n",

This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.

However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

Ifyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards salesabove monthly index without enough consideration of futurereplacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should beinjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meetdemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in orderto fill storage?2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away toomuch gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting theirown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas thantheir injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to shortterm prices.

      "{'date': 'Tue, 24 Oct 2000 06', 'subject': 'Investment Structure', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Keith Holst', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion fo=r the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period =in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third qua=rter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$85=4 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions=and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th=e third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, c=ompared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common =share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, in=cremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operat=inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-ta=x) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer finan=cing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated =illion (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of=the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; a=nd a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately=50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components=business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensat=ion from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nor=tel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third qu=arter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   \"Revenues f=or the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry a=djusted to new levels of spending,\" said John Roth, president and chief exe=cutive officer Nortel Networks. \"Our bottom line results reflected the impa=ct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During th=e third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implemen=t its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The=Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b=reak even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structu=re is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.\"   Frank Dunn, =the Company\\'s new president and chief executive officer effective November =1, 2001, said, \"Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organiz=, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services an=d voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless N=etworks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product progra=ms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p=ortfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help=them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct=ions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor=tunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 day=packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         =softswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe =and         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP,=MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G=Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the fir=st commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP c=all;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated  =Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge        =Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanc=ed software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX =solution.\"    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects =to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o=f its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction=s are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A =workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart=er of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continu=e to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The numbe=r of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including=the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul=timately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the =quarter, Frank Dunn said, \"We are extremely pleased with the results that h=ave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi=cant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio=ns. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by=completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which=, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati=ons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan=ced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and action=s we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet i=s well positioned.\"   \"While we believe we are beginning to see early indic=ations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl=e levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the u=ncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa=ke of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu=sinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua=rter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,\" concluded Dunn.         R=evenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure reven=ues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third=quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada =and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline =in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Eu=rope. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, E=urope and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet=revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and =Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photon=ic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co=mpared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was l=argely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-cit=y solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues decline=d 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Su=bstantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and st=rong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable decl=ines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wire=less OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on =October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Netwo=rks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks wil=l evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning =in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter =of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the Uni=ted States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States a=nd Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001,=revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$1=9.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuin=g operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or U=S$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 bill=ion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in=2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations=, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions=and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intang=ible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US=$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending=Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its c=ost structure. Compared to the Company\\'s year-end 2000 cost structure, excl=usive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company\\'s cost structure a=t the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billi=on.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was =approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$=750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the exp=ected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Exclud=ing the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gro=ss margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compa=red to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expe=nses    Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the third =quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market ad=justments and further decline in some of our of customers\\' financial condit=ion resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter rel=ated to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental prov=isions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared =to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Res=earch and development (\"R&D\") expenses were US$808 million in the third qua=rter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments t=o drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the eliminat=ion of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001,=R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100=million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operation=s.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (\"NNL\"), Nortel Ne=tworks Corporation\\'s principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated=into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly =traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring c=harge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workfor=ce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business str=eamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the a=pproximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonic=s Components business.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.Thank you for your support.Enron Global Technology-----Original Message-----Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.Enron Messaging Administration'}\n",

You\\'ll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy =players just like yourself!   =09Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I=start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Te=rry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce =Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answe=r - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he\\'s a must- start agai=nst a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards a=nd three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously=not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we\\'d have t=o go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so =going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To a=nswer your second question, we\\'d recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carol=ina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It\\'s tough to choose Davis, but=Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at=best, so our hands are tied.  =09Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye th=is week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weink=e. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsist=ent from a Fantasy perspective, so we\\'d have to side with Weinke. He\\'ll be =facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players=like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a b=ig game.  =09non Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin J=ohnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still av=ailable.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre\\'s favorite target i=n the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sha=rpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we hi=ghly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his =current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he\\'s just not =good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers=will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after an=other No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fa=ntasy player.  =09giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive optio=n the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk a=fter five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes=will continue to be a productive player all season.   =09This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Interesting.KenIndigestionDaniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE\\'s Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation\\'s growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid.Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation\\'s electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen.Studness determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there\\'s plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand.Addressing a Burning IssueIf natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.WINNERS  \\t\\t\\tSales* ($bil) \\tRemarksCalpine \\t\\t\\t\\t$4.6 \\t\\tIts gas power plants won\\'t compete with coal for yearsChesapeake Energy \\t\\t0.9 \\t\\tHedged gas production through December 2003Dynegy \\t\\t\\t43.4 \\t\\tOwns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gasPeabody Energy \\t\\t2.7 \\t\\tWorld\\'s largest coal companyLOSERS  \\t\\t\\tSales* ($bil) \\tRemarksDevon Energy \\t\\t\\t3.3 Gas-heavy; \\t$8 billion in ...debtGeneral Electric \\t\\t129.5 \\t\\tSells gas turbinesPioneer Natural Resources \\t1.0 \\t\\t$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gasTransocean SedcoForex \\t1.9 \\t\\t$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure\"It\\'s not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,\" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. \"It\\'s our game to displace older gas.\"Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day.That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy\\'s 35-year-old coal plants are \"huge capital hogs,\" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says.But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules.'}\n",

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 p=ercent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billio=n, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company\\'s return on e=quity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively aff=of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the =September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in c=ns related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, i=nsurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination =of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after=-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since=September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequentl=y, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost=of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of th=e company\\'s offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery =expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company\\'s offices, extra =operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluat=ed. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses=will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge inc=ludes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and a=sset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reor=ganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending i=n certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locatio=ns, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain pr=ocessing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expec=ted to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A por=tion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form o=f improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinves=ted back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activ=ities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress=on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the yea=r and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million. =Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-=time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down =19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 perce=nt. The company\\'s adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   \"While we w=ere on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terro=rist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and =we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and inv=estment activity slowed after September 11th,\" said Kenneth I. Chenault, ch=airman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. \"In light of =the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower=our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering in=itiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our business=es with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated be=nefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franc=hise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in=the economy.\"   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net incom=e of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a=year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127=million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also include=d in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-tim=e costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist at=tacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS\\' net income =would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last y=ear.   TRS\\' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee reven=ues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a =28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decre=ase in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel sinc=e September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarte=r was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offs=et a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance ch=arge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yie=lds. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introd=uctory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter=.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of =higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinque=ncies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certa=in marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating=expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and busine=ss volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineer=ing and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results \"=on a managed basis\" as if there had been no securitization transactions, wh=ich conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS resu=lts on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both fo=rmats.   On a reported basis, TRS\\' results included securitization gains of=$29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 m=illion after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. The=se gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and=therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   Americ=an Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 =million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago.=Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $=62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge note=d earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claim=s directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA\\'s net inc=ome would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA re=sults reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on =the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly =lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, man=agement and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, exclud=ing the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due=primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-=control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the=company\\'s $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securit=ies, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduct=ion reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfo=lio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) repo=rted a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net i=ncome a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax=($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excludi=ng these charges, AEB\\'s net income would have been $15 million, approximate=ly double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB s=ustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks=, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these co=sts did not impact AEB\\'s quarterly results.   AEB\\'s business results reflec=t strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Re=sults also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses =as a result of AEB\\'s reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by hi=gher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan b=alances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues =to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Co=rporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 m=illion a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million p=re-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.   =2001 Third Quarter Earnings Supplement will be available today on the Ameri=estor conference call to discuss third quarter earnings results, operating =performance and other topics that may be raised during the discussion will =/ir.americanexpress.com .

We pretty much make whatever youwould like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings aredurable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownneris rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are onlycharged for the materials.Our most popular size and style is the 8\\' x 12\\' barn . This is the mosteconomical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to agiven site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedarstyle grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We haveusually build them with a 3\\'-10 1/2\" wide door opening.  I would think thatwould be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have yourdad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and soldover 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usuallyvaries between $800 and $900.Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which isa bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminumsoffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for JoePronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversizeand legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Yourdad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.The picture I am attaching shows a common 3\\' entry door.  We are presentlybuilding a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6\\' wide roll updoor.  The price on a 10\\' x 12\\' shed with a 6\\' wide roll-up door would beroughly $1500.We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet yourneeds.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be theeasiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by MondayOctober 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able tofinish that one on time.Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364My Home number 715-985-3063.Have a good one and take with you later.Sincerely,Mel Nelson'}\n",

No hand-outs were provided.Calculation of Receipt Point CapacityTopock  540 mmcf/dEhrenberg 1250 mmcf/dNeedles 800 mmcf/dWheeler 800 mmcf/dNew Receipt PointsKramer Junction 200 mmcf/dHector Rd 50 mmcf/dBoth will be available around Feb 1Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows CalculationCurrently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.New Calculation, Changes and DisplayBased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.OFO DeclarationName changes from overnominationCan declare before any CycleProvide 2 hour noticePost on Gas SelectShow OFO Calculation on Gas SelectWindowsReason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into systemCalculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO'sNow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.Scheduling Changes-Nov 1Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycleCopy confirmed nomsAll noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.2 Hour NoticeSocal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFONominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.Use Elapsed Pro-Rata RulesExpected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cutCycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cutCylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cutWindows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled VolumesCycle 1                                    Cycle 2Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1Cycle 3\\t\\t\\t\\tevening cyle 2 on 10/4Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.Winter Balancing RulesEffective Nov 1-March 31No changes.All customers must comply.Minimum delivery requirements50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)70% of daily usage depending on storage level70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min90% of daily usage depending on storage level90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.

These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.

There are a couple ofpossible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variancefrom the decision makers when the time comes.In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellersdisclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the finalword from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have somenew information.Thanks,Bob Huntley----- Original Message -----Bob,I do have a survey of the sight at home.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.\"}\n",

Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner\\'s huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants\\'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He\\'ll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we\\'ll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

mike.zipperer@enron.comWelcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center SouthYou will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.NEC MonitorsThe NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.Turret UsersAn \"Alliance MX turret quick reference guide\" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as \"Caller ID\" and \"Voicemail Indication\".Increased Information AccessChannel\\tAvaya\\tStentophonWeather Channel\\t12401\\t801CNN Headlines News\\t12402\\t802CNN Financial News\\t12403\\t803CNBC\\t12404\\t804MSNBC\\t12405\\t805Bloomberg\\t12406\\t806Financial News Network\\t12407\\t807CNN\\t12408\\t808Fox Sports\\t12409\\t809ESPN1\\t12410\\t810Wireless TelephonyYou may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network \"in-building\" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.Wireless LANThe infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.Amtel ReplacementAs a move to provide a more flexible \"Plug n Play\" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.Keeping an Open forum', 'subject': 'Enron Center South Technology Watch', 'x-from': 'Enron Center South Technology </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MBX_ECST>', 'x-to': \"Acevedo, Rudy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Raceved>, Agarwalla, Dipak </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dagarwal>, Aggarwal, Anubhav </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aaggarwa>, Alexander, Kim </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=EU/cn=Recipients/cn=kalexand>, Allen, Diana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dallen3>, Allen, Phillip K. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pallen>, Ames, Chuck </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cames>, Anderson, Jonathan D. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Janders6>, Arnold, John </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jarnold>, Arora, Harry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Harora>, Bailey, Debra </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dbailey2>, Bajwa, Bilal </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bbajwa>, Ballato, Russell </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rballato>, Ballinger, Ted </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tballing>, Barbe, Robin </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbarbe>, Barker, James R. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jbarker>, Barnum, Christopher </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=5d528f5e-26694541-86256513-82f479>, Bass, Eric </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ebass>, Bass, Kathy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kbass>, Bates, Kimberly </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kbates>, Baughman Jr., Don </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dbaughm>, Baughman, Edward D. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ebaughm>, Baumbach, David </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dbaumba>, Bayer, Adam </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Abayer>, Belsha, Lorie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lbelsha>, Benchluch, Moises </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbenchlu>, Benjelloun, Hicham </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hbenjell>, Benke, Terrell </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tbenke>, Bennett, Stephen </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbennet3>, Benson, Robert </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbenson>, Bentley, Corry </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cbentle>, Bermack, Andrew </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Notesaddr/cn=e3053f86-1615ca59-86256a8e-5ac2a9>, Berutti, Aaron </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aberutti>, Black, Don </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dblack>, Black, Tamara Jae </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tblack>, Blaine, Jay </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jblaine>, Bolt, Laurel </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lbolt>, Brawner, Sandra F. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrawne>, Breslau, Craig </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cbresla>, Broderick, Paul J. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pbroder>, Bronstein, Mara </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mbronst2>, Brooks, Loretta </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lbrooks>, Brundrett, Clifton </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cbrundre>, Bryan, Gary </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Gbryan>, Bryant, Rachel </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rbryant2>, Burk, Bart </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bburk>, Burnett, Lisa </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lburnett>, Buss, Jerome </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jbuss2>, Canacoo, Tetteh </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tcanacoo>, Capasso, Joe </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jcapasso>, Cardenas, Catalina </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ccardena>, Carson, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mcarson2>, Chang, Sheila </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Schang2>, Chen, Hai </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hchen2>, Chilkina, Elena </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Echilkin>, Chiu, Lindon </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Lchiu>, Choate, Jason </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jchoate>, Cline, Kevin </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kcline>, Clyatt, Julie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jclyatt>, Clynes, Terri </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tclynes>, Collins, Dustin </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Dcollin>, Colwell, Wes </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Wcolwel>, Concannon, Ruth </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rconcan>, Cuilla, Martin </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mcuilla>, Curry, Mike </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mcurry>, Dalton III, Oscar </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Odalton>, Davis, Mark Dana </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mdavis>, Day, Amanda </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Aday2>, Day, Smith L. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sday>, Dayao, Anthony </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Adayao>, Dean, Clint </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Cdean>, Decook, Todd </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tdecook>, Denetsosie, Troy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tdenets>, Des Champs, Joseph </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JDesCham>, Dickerson, Lloyd </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ldicker2>, Donohoe, Tom </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Tdonoho>, Draper, David </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ddraper>, Dronet, David </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ddronet>, Duffy, Matthew </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mduffy>, Duran, W.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We\\'ll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \\t[IMAGE]\\tInside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week[IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you\\'re in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player\\'s statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who\\'s been getting the most consistent production.Question - Mike Blake     I\\'m having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he\\'s risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he\\'s losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week\\'s opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde\\'s Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets\\' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won\\'t have an easier time against Oakland. We\\'d suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.This message has been sent to pallen@enron.com, provided free of charge and free of obligation.

I appreciate your efforts.By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?Bob----- Original Message -----Bob,I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will beon January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impressionthat yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some usefulsuggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the additionforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the newspace.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and usethe new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off theexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room thatis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could beused for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you wouldnot have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert theplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you couldslope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place alarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as yourdrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area belowthe addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to thedriveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the houseso that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchento the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, Ithink opening the dining room would be the better idea.I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested inexploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggestsomething in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want meto try and sketch out these ideas.Phillip-----Original Message-----**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient (s).

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.Ken Lay\"}\n",

Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It\\'s hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won\\'t offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we\\'ll go with the New  England QB.This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.

The beginning of Section 6.3 states \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?\".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of \"a single sum distribution\" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.Phillip-----Original Message-----For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a \"single sum distribution,\" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.'}\n",

We  See Upswing Con=tinuing   By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   Selective  accumulation r=emains in order.  The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary wi=dely in degree.  As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become f=ar less  dramatic.   Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early b=ecause of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to =September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That\\'s about average for rebounds =in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this =week\\'s edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries fr=om the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won ba=ck an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine insta=nces, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two mo=nths and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six =months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovere=d after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in=a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but tha=t\\'s typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associat=ed  with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well  before =the headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would  be consistent =with the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.=While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won\\'t necessarily keep the  b=ull market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion  was the long=est in history and gave rise to \"new era\"  optimism. Corporations, especial=ly in information technology,  built production and sales capacity to level=s far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being correcte=d, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the eco=nomy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  st=art looking much more reasonable.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant\\'s deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=.1 should apply.

Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.\"We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. \"That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.\"A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.\"These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,\" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.\"The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.\"With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.\"It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,\" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.\"We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.\"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,\"said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way.\"', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Thomas A Martin, Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Jay Reitmeyer, Frank Ermis'}\n",

Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.

I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

This would produce an average sqfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought hissales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sellfor $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) therent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your ownevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if wewere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroomunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely,George W.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but nowwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000Allan SeverudeMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECTFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidatedWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood.

      "{'date': 'Tue, 24 Oct 2000 06', 'subject': 'Investment Structure', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Keith Holst', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet basedreporting.BOOKKEEPINGI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeepingprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.INVESTOR INPUTWe are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As alwaysthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in myexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presumeKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make everyeffort to be accommodating.CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURESCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not asformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn\\'t enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\\'s still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.\\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn\\'t result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

(DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state\\'s powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company\\'s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"Thomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict\\'s\" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.\"I guess our position is, \\'Gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.\"We\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\\'s explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

The bookcovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 yearslearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that havelasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and goodbackground information for sustainable builder folks.Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.Moore</A>Regards,Harry Francis'}\n",

Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.\"The market\\'s been waiting for this day for a long time,\" aStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn\\'t lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.Thursday\\'s system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour.

Ifyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards salesabove monthly index without enough consideration of futurereplacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should beinjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meetdemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in orderto fill storage?2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away toomuch gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting theirown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas thantheir injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to shortterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the majorLDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floatingrate.  This market has been long historically.

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators forthe rise in gas prices.\"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.\"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.\"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December\\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.\"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said.A year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.\"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\\'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation\\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\\'s cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.\"I was getting worried,\" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January\\'s weather turned warmer.Wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\\'s gas purchasing practices.\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\\'s time to considersome changes.\"To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail toseverly@kcstar.com.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star'}\n",

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

Cash NeedsSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II. Credit RelationshipsSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=nd=20payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond==20indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =its=20rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade==20issues within the last three weeks.III. Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV. Cost Containment InitiativesHighlightsSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital==20Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77Capital Improvement Costs                383Total                                             $ 460The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to==20be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=om=20contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the==20most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII. Earnings of California AffiliatesSCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500==20million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20This increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20www.cpuc.ca.gov.=20Dan', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst'}\n",

I have shiftedto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I couldnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning moretowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  Onewing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  Thisplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with thecourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoorliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglassskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to havesingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I wouldlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, Iwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.

What isgoing on?#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty\\'s tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.

I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty\\'s tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.

The agency said it hadbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that thesales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today thanyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California becauseof concerns about its water reserves.

What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  Whattype of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass orCellulose?5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't knowthe difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to preventcracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partialone out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath underthe stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermountstainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Ironrailings?15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price exceptfor change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision butthis is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going tocall Cary Kipp tosee about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.PhillipI\"}\n",

Any experience with FHA221(d) loans?Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment2%- overhead4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached anextremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see evenreducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would onlygenerate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled aboutsuch a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost downto $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus youlocal connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out ofthe office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.Phillip'}\n",

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information.'}\n",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California\\'s problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.'}\n",

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.

TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let\\'s talk.'}\n",

I would wait a bit for Wink\\'s bid though. Yousay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. Ijust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel costwas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and wecan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of thetrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.Richard MorganManager, Green Building ProgramAustin Energy721 Barton Springs Rd.Austin, TX 78704-1194Ph. 512.505.3709Fax 512.505.3711e-mail richard.morgan@austinenergy.com-----Original Message-----Richard,I spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building withSIP\\'s.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I candecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprintscompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP\\'s with8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof.I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio thatis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay withinthat budget.  I don\\'t want to settle for a conventional stick builthouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of aradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the sameenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP\\'s. For example, I just spoke toa sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additionalcosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would helpme construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid fromWink with Premier based on you reference.Thank you for your help.Phillip Allenpallen@enron.com713-853-7041**********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient (s).

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.

It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don\\'t understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.\"  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.Thank you,Phillip Allen'}\n",

Thank youmix of structurers, originators and tradersI've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we willfollow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The maindifference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time withthem for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take atleast 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.(11/26-11/28)--Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs(11/28-11/30)--Contact SMEs to give them background regardingthe simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time todiscuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.(12/3-12/6)--Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content weneed and where they can provide stories.--Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review thestories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the videoshoot.--Make changes to stories, if necessary.--Send final stories and video shoot logistics toSMEs(12/10-12/12)--Video shootPlease let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,AnnThis message is for the designated recipient only and may containprivileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.

However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME\\'s today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).SheriWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a \"Dateline\" type theme for one, and a \"60 Minute\" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?Cheers KirkKirk McDanielMichelleThanks for your support of the BRM project. Here are the remaining scripts. Tim and I will review them too and forward our comments to you. Any feedback on the first two scripts? Again, Thanks!!CheersKirkKirk -I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) foryou to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated inthe scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company asboth Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so thatthere is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coachexit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.

With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.I have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.In any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here.

This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=f Enron Corp. common stock.There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distrib=ution of all of the Participant\\'s deferral accounts\" indicates that one pay=ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The val=ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".=This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=ction 6.3.The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=esRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,65810% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 sharesI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. ==20In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=er.Sincerely,Phillip Allen   =20=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09'}\n",

A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.'}\n",

Temperaturescould climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.\"Most of the day\\'s activity took place in the early part ofthe morning,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"By options expirationthe market had pretty much dried up.\"Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the mainreason for the decline in spot market prices.Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to theNew York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per millionBritish thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. SinceMonday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecastsindicated reduced utility load requirements.In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies theynormally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weatherforecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the$67.00-$75.00 range.

Natural gas prices were a large factor in recentelectricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-firedgeneration to meet increased weather-related demand.Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an averageof 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million Britishthermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an averageof 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.\"The weather\\'s moderating and gas is down, so you\\'ve gotpeople coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"These are muchmore realistic prices.\"Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if theoutlook for weather continues to be mild.

Adding that other structures willprobably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can moreeasily be assessed.-Nick LivingstoneNordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather ForecastLysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power priceson the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher todayas colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday\\'s closing trade on 1,076megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.\"The market\\'s been waiting for this day for a long time,\" aStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn\\'t lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.Thursday\\'s system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday\\'s last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.Vattenfall\\'s Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.Today\\'s rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday\\'s news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone=0F$- daily.pdf'}\n",
