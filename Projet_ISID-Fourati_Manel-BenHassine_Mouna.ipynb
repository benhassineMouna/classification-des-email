I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.

These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.

The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..

There is a 100 MW server farmtrying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 monthsdue to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rudeawakening in the next 2-3 years.---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000Enron North America Corp.Broderick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Miller/NA/Enron@EnronPM ---------------------------George HopleyCOMMUNICATIONS@ENRONInternet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain onLocal Utilities( September 05, 2000 )In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called ExodusCommunications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center inTukwila.The mission was to handle the Internet traffic andcomputer servers for theregion\\'s growing number of dot-coms.Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.\"We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. \"That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.\"A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.\"These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,\" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.\"The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.\"With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.\"It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,\" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.\"We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.\"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,\"said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way.\"', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Thomas A Martin, Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Jay Reitmeyer, Frank Ermis'}\n",

TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let\\'s talk.'}\n",

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.

We are pursuing a confidentialityagreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enableus to develop proposals.

In preparation for that meeting we would like togain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What aretypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your maincontacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving ourcontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probablyhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with thecommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from theircommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of monthindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  Thatrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.'}\n",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California\\'s problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information.'}\n",

According to BPA,it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meetbiological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so inorder to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it hadbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that thesales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today thanyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California becauseof concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sendingexchange energy into California, however.More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of theWestern Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.\"}\n",

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.

It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos canproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments forlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognizethat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental ratesthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do notbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement thatwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5million.

I have gathered more information that support my concerns.Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5Unit Cost, Site work, &builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 millionLand      1.15Interim Financing     .85Common Areas       .80Total     $10.4Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable toget comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class Aproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can producethe same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and theseasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood iscurrently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer tothe appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the marketwill sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablelyincrease to drive this market more in balance.After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and costestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  Hefeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that wecannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.We would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.Phillip\"}\n",

I think he was surprised that we were set up withemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff knowthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see theproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can showthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay rightnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meetbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wadecontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve theproperty\\'s tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better andbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  Itis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people movein that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  Irealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor andyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and beworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are runningan errand for the property.I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at thistime.  We can look at again later in the year.I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.Phillip'}\n",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn\\'t enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\\'s still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.\\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn\\'t result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

(DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state\\'s powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company\\'s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"Thomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict\\'s\" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.\"I guess our position is, \\'Gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.\"We\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\\'s explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Onewing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  Thisplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with thecourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoorliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglassskylights supported by metal posts.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance andrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra laborcost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent onrepairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsitemanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager hasinterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male managerthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to amanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manageronsite.3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If youwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structurethis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive.

Cash NeedsSCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=plete=20cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=s=20and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=.8=20million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II.

Energy Cost ScenariosHighlightsThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=such=20scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV.

Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20Activity)As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s==20Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=e=20end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit==20balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN ProposalAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=RN=20to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=s.=20The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=t=20would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=ift=20costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=the=20revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =in=20the TRA is overstated.VI. Flow of Funds AnalysisIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a==20positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to==20its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its==20shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=on=20stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=ve=20and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]=20VIII.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would berecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 wouldbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as theinvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentionedearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you aspart of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit fromhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase1 complete in November)+5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule-5% equity for over budget and behind scheduleThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, butcould be as favorable as 55/45.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentiallycomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed withthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (ofwhat, I\\'m not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs whoswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for theQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December(and maybe earlier).PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take theForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to getsome assurances of payment.SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are dueon 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E\\'spurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can beresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.

      "{'date': '01/20/01 22', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'mike.grigsby@enron.com', 'body': 'By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City StarAs natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York MercantileExchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gasstorage number.The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and theforecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated asupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.\"Traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson,a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\"But the market\\'s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American GasAssociation\\'s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled thestorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view thenumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker thanreality.\"It\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand whatwe are reporting,\" McGill said.As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointingfingers at Wall Street.Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recentlystepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators forthe rise in gas prices.\"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adiktold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electricutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blamefor this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect theircustomers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to takeprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of priceinsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gasprices before they soared.\"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said PaulSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.\"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs tochange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy SecurityAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.Hot topicmany circles, little else is discussed.The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City isfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double theprevious December\\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills aswell.The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part ofhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financialpledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.\"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said.A year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 perthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhileto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid bycustomers.But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousandcubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storagefor winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy InformationAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heatingbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gasmarkets.\"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New Yorktraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatilecommodity in the world.Setting the priceIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price ofgas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began tradingcontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon hadwidespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soonas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in saleprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, fromutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in whatthey pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intentionof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledgeof natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need toknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. Like allfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds totheir volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of moneyin a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was lessthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\\'sweekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect toneed in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less thanaverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, inhopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would besufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, theconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storagenumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said theassociation\\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.But some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. William Eliason, vicepresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\\'s cold snap hadcontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.\"I was getting worried,\" he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January\\'s weather turned warmer.Wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures pricesdropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing throughSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase butpass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gascharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri GasEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said lastmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little couldbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserveenergy.Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected tosave an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek anextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would notguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have leftcustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whetherthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuelcosts.On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the PublicCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission toperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\\'s gas purchasing practices.\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\\'s time to considersome changes.\"To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail toseverly@kcstar.com.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star'}\n",

In attendance were Ken Lay,the Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and hisideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of nextweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based onmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials JeffDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding ourproposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situationwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoingcommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities togo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than whatthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has morework to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  Hetalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retaillevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for thebenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which hewould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market orientedsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fixthe problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemedinterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting agoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilitiesto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rateanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issuesincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gaspurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to findingsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" ofgeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers thatthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  Thiswas a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plusbasis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation inCalifornia.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would morewidely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west foraddtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plantmaintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service atany one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hearmore about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should beable to help out here).Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We madesome headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buysome portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generationthereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and controlapproach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.thoughts and get them to Kari)He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --not just the 5 one year strips.He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of thedeal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of theforward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.

The project is a 134 unit apartment complex inSan Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly acouple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would liketo find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does notrequire the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way tostructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that hasbeen mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce theequity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of thisnature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim topermanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will beimportant to banks.I am faxing you a project summary.

Ifyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards salesabove monthly index without enough consideration of futurereplacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should beinjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meetdemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in orderto fill storage?2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away toomuch gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting theirown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas thantheir injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to shortterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the majorLDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floatingrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers marketand theconsumer has benefitted.Call me if you need any more input.Phillip\"}\n",

Note that theconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than ourstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratioof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costsare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we haveactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psfwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairlysure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3bedroom.

Any possibility for a=deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=us is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=ll be very difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=e would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=l disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the =details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should get =paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20=20According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.=20Key Points of the Bridge Financing=09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B=09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M=09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%Current Projected=20For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=ier in the crisis.=20SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=the DWR proportionately from rate payments.'}\n",

      "{'date': 'Tue, 24 Oct 2000 06', 'subject': 'Investment Structure', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Keith Holst', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com><clclegal2@aol.com>Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not ownany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky trackto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTINGWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?

Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede afterforecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia fornext week. These producers typically generate power to preventreservoirs from overflowing.Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to risewith falling temperatures because of increased requirements forspace heating.Traded volume on the power exchange increased in activetrading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traderssaid.\"The market\\'s been waiting for this day for a long time,\" aStockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have beenselling because winter hasn\\'t lived up to expectations. We shouldnow see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fallbelow freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limitedchances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to WeatherServices Corp. in the U.S.The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand wasexpected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predicttemperatures to begin falling.Thursday\\'s system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely riseby 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-term contracts.Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,1.9 kroner below yesterday\\'s last trade at 135.25 kroner amegawatt-hour.Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, althoughexpected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producersto meet the increased demand, other traders said.Vattenfall\\'s Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.Today\\'s rapid increase was likely induced by traders who usedtoday\\'s news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone=0F$- daily.pdf'}\n",

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but nowwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000Allan SeverudeMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECTFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidatedWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but nowwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000Allan SeverudeMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECTFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidatedWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.

The land is selling for $2.50 per squarefoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in WestSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexesand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  Thisproperty will have the best location for student housing of all newprojects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as thereis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is notyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I willknow more on this question later today.Sincerely,George W.

It appears that a singlebuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid abovemarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices werebypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the indexcalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associatedfinancial swaps for San Juan.We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed fromSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades fromEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokeragefirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries theliability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANSThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership andany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be inthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors andall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee theloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally meansthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profitsis reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, arefull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often benon-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENTThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees fororganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlikemany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees toCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred overthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTSThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land costrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months ofextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan atprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchaseprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimatedmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plusapproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOANOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will requirethe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to asthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion ofimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once theimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will befor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year aftercompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you shouldexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lotimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or anirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as adevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are notspent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of afinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially ashigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior toobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirementprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for theimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan wouldcover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of fundsspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in thepreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing atentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which cansignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the totallot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  Theimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for designcosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing andlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan forundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I wouldestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then theloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would giveyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity requiredof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasingis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as theseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utilitystandpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANSThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  isa construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in thebuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the constructionloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans tostart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loansin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have anyconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are toodifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans forpre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  willbe from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTSDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current andnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to prioritypayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partnerwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and thefee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior tocalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnershipexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it hasto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, orcannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake thisfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtainfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it isused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.

In the EXTREMELY tight labor marketobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professionalsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORSYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I canprovide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Callwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely,George RichardsPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC- winmail.dat'}\n",

This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.

Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.

As you can tell from the proforma this projectshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong asAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range forthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that wehave uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  Asit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austinfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be completein less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severewater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lotimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in NorthAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and streetwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require streetwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pondrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is notexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quitesuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as theadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoodsis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but mayonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are farpreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyerpreferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 andan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved siteplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close intoan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in theprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discusshaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entitywith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is arental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would thenbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with anexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in SanAntonio if you do not know anyone.I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want toschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon asyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at anytime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with youon this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusualevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpgdowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled tostart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enoughto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it tookanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to takemy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebrain her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden thispast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realizethe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks asif she will be ok in the long run.George W.

Exodus is now wrapping upconstructionon a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less thana mile from itsoriginal facility. Sitting at the confluence of severalfiber optic backbones, theExodus plant will consume enough power for a small town andeventuallyhouse Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive datacenters near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,Globix andHostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will housethe networkingequipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect oneverything from yourmonthly electric bill to the ease with which you accessyour favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities andserver farms, aresprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the KentValley that somehave expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light andPuget SoundEnergy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,high-securityfacilities.\"We are talking to about half a dozen customers thatare requesting 445megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"said KarlKarzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget SoundEnergy. \"That isthe equivalent of six oil refineries.\"A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,the rise of the Internetdata center has some utility veterans scratching theirheads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the WashingtonUtilities andTransportation Commission to accept a tariff on the newdata centers. Thetariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existingresidential and businesscustomers from footing the bill for the new base stationsnecessary to supportthe projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20million each,Karzmar said.Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans tobring up the data centerissue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes,businesses and schools in theregion, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazingappetite for power --represent potentially lucrative business customers. Thefacilities run 24 hours aday, seven days a week, and therefore could become aconstant revenuestream. On the other hand, they require so much energy thatthey couldpotentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capitalexpenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it willmean for power ratesin the area is still open to debate.\"These facilities are what we call extremely denseloads,\" said Bob Royer,director of communications and public affairs at SeattleCity Light.\"The entire University of Washington, from stadiumlights at the footballgame to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have datacenter projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40and 50 megawatts.\"With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergatecomplex in Tukwila isone of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchasedthe 1.35 millionsquare-foot Intergate East facility last September fromBoeing Space &Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased92 percent of thesix-building complex to seven different co-locationcompanies.\"It is probably the largest data center park in thecountry,\" boasts LaurentPoole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICGCommunications,NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and ZamaNetworks alllease space in the office park.After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997,Sabey has become anexpert in the arena and now has facilities either undermanagement ordevelopment in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Pooleclaims his firm isone of the top four builders of Internet data centers inthe country.As more people access the Internet and conductbandwidth-heavy taskssuch as listening to online music, Poole said the need forco-location space inSeattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle. The need for data centerspace is growing at arapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,causing similarconcerns among utilities in places such as Texas andCalifornia.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-locationspace, plans to nearlydouble the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companiessuch as Amazon.com run their own server farms, manyhigh-tech companieshave decided to outsource the operations to companies suchas Exodus thatmay be better prepared for dealing with Internet trafficmanagement.\"We have 2 million square feet of space underconstruction and we plan todouble our size in the next nine months , yet there is moredemand right nowthan data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an accountexecutive at Exodus inSeattle.The booming market for co-location space has left somein the local utilityindustry perplexed.\"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to doto serve the growth,\"said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry isalmost stunned by this, ina way.\"', 'subject': '', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Thomas A Martin, Mike Grigsby, Keith Holst, Jay Reitmeyer, Frank Ermis'}\n",

TheWSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposesthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, butthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule theirgeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then youwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern californiamunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simplyschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having saidall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives onthe generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  Whilethey don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number isbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on theload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this withothers up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gasdemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small theUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginalconsumer then it is obviously a different story.Let\\'s talk.'}\n",

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not bean issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this isO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me toget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know andI'll take care of it..On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygatecurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change youroverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affectssomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)GDP-Kingsgate.Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see fivedifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be forwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as aQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means isthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transportlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have asystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seemsthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's thedetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where itappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may bean operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollarimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just incase there's something you want to do about it.

David Moore spent over 10 yearslearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that havelasted over 2000 years.

Any possibility for adeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicansand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus isreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans andDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once thebonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" intothe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature andthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details ofthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-termpower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that thebond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach ofcontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridgeloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be verydifficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the statewould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the GeneralFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even thisconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for fulldisclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including thedetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before theywill support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This billpassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack ofRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs forcommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may beamended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state shouldget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would belikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to moneyavailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has statedthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  TheRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary andthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.Key Points of the Bridge FinancingLehman Brothers  $1.0 BBear Stearns  $625 MTax-Exempt Rate  4.77%Current ProjectedFor more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This TimeThe Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create theCalifornia Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billionauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must beauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or theadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasingpower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of theseauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts thegovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bondamount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay tosupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paidfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. forthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this canbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting thisidea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and BankruptcyAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  Thefirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and thegovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU isAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  Accordingto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal hassigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davisand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicatesthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntarybankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bondissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, thestate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included andpassed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file forbankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities andthe DWR proportionately from rate payments.'}\n",

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely thatthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in largepart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at whichthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairmanbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment oranswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert hadPrice caps are almost never the right answerPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagesCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reducedemand, is not acceptableEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they wouldexport California\\'s problems to the WestThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a prettystrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissionerout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda andif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off theagenda.  Hope this info helps.

      "{'date': 'Tue, 10 Apr 2001 10', 'subject': 'CAISO demand reduction', 'x-from': 'Phillip K Allen', 'x-to': 'Mike Grigsby', 'body': '---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2001Enron North America Corp.Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael M Driscoll/PDX/ECT@ECT, ChrisMallory/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT,Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mark Fischer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Bill WilliamsIII/PDX/ECT@ECT, Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECTPhillip et al.,the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demandover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting fortemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translatesinto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) ascompared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntaryreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Otherforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (makingtotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couplemore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to theretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that itis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to lastyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa inJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservationare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood ofmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the generaleconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at leastmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control areaonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISOportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions indemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  Asyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminumsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off atleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets itswish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Severalmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they aresharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactlyhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'seconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest ofthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, Ithink we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% alreadyrealized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in thenon-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for theWSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide youwith updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, Ihope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have anyquestions or need any further information.'}\n",

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British ColumbiaHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwestregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paidabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn\\'t enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawattsof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawattsof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. Themunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess powerinto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWPis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suitclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal BonnevillePower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into themarket at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying alltransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the stateno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is havingto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willingto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday duringa conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergencyWednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declaredwhen the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power isinterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only asa means of attracting additional electricity resources.\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"Dorinson said.Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energyunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost ofthe high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to highwholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow bynearly $1 billion, analysts said. It\\'s still unclear whether retailcustomers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricityrates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncPwr Plant(This article was originally published Wednesday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California IndependentSystem Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke EnergyCorp.\\'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the statesince Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for thereasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since Monday,7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to theISO.The ISO manages grid reliability.As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alertat 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state woulddip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid gridcollapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn\\'t result in rollingblackouts.The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),Reliant Energy Inc.

(AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) saidWednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped bysome of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimatereasons.The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state\\'s powergrid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California PublicUtilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all powerplants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW forunplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergencyfor the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% andcustomers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may becalled on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesdayevening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AESand Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspectionof the company\\'s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesdaymorning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, AES spokesman AaronThomas said.Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representativesreturned Wednesday for a full inspection.AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions CreditsThe Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities haveused up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken downtwo weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air QualityManagement District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,Thomas said.AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entireHuntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitosand Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AEShas refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine thecompany $20 million for polluting.\"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"Thomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air qualitydistrict\\'s\" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AEScould have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its offline plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUCDynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesdayevening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off lineWednesday.\"I guess our position is, \\'Gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if youneed to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said Dynegyspokesman Lynn Lednicky.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance andthe other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which couldpose a safety hazard if not repaired.\"We\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"Weeven paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\"Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy\\'s explanation ofwhy its units were off line.-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-001317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

I spoke to him about the possibility of your calland he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by KippFlores can be used.Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left veryoptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas aboutmoving this project forward.Phillip\"}\n",

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of whichcurrent unpaid invoices due total $37,325.Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into thisproject for more than five months and have completed most of the major designand other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm ofour size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed orrejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on apercentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based onyour prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%,or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For thesecond, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 peryear, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of thesevaluations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes theforfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, inthe hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of futureprojects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 permonth to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in theattached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest bringsthe total net buyout to $78,946.?We still believe that this project needs the professional services that weoffer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyoutoffer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we areprepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.?If this is yourchoice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.?

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding theproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are anumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forwardon the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on aBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjustedpro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we areacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about500+units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,this,we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a seriouseffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requestedloan amount to $8,868,000.Pro-Forma                           Bank's AdjustmentUnit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $4753 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $4172.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unitturn over.3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can supportdebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25xdebtcoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provideLand -                   $1,121,670Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000Cash Equity              $1,419,268Total                    $2,955,9387.
